# RecipeFetcher

This iOS app was developed by Adam Sadler as part of a job application proecess. Below is a template provide to me to include as part of my submission.

### Steps to Run the App
1. Clone project with provided link
2. Open with Xcode
3. Select run destination
4. Run the app

### Focus Area: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I started off building out the NetworkManager object along with the Recipe models. I chose to focus on these areas first because they would be the most important to test and having data to load would make working on the UI a lot easier.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about 4 hours on this project all together. I mostly divided my time equally between planning out the project, building out the networking layer with needed utilities, building out the UI, and then writing unit tests and testing on a physical device.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I feel like I didn't put as much time into the UI as I would have liked to. I'm used to working with UX designer who provide designs to work from, so planning out the UI from scratch took a bit longer than usual.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I would say the weakest part would be the UI and I would have liked to spend more time on that.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
I did not use any external libraries or dependencies.

### Additional Information: Is there aything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This was a fun little project!
